# RandomPasswordGenerator
Random Password Generator with Copy to Clipboard Function

## Description 

This project was created to show my skills using the newly learned Javascript material. The project objective was to create a responsive web page in which a random password could be generated using Javascript. The password was expected to have some user input such as password length which would be determined using user prompts. In addition, the project expectations included the function to copy the newly created password to the clipboard. I learned a great deal of new information creating this project and had many setbacks, some of which included determining how to randomized characters using a "for loop". The html/css on the project I found to be fairly simple to create which gave me some relief. This project has taught me that Javascript is an extremely difficult programming language and requires much practice.

## Usage

1) Page will prompt you to choose a password length (between 8-128 characters). Once chosen click "ok".
2) Next you will be givin a series of questions regarding which characters to include in your password. Click "ok" on all alerts to use all available character sets.
3) The page will load, and then click the "generate password" button which will create a password with the length specified in the first prompt.
4) A random password will appear in the text area, you can then click the "copy password" button and have your newly created password copied to the clipboard.
